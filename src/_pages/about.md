Corey Coomes was formally trained as a photographer and animator, yet after college he found himself enjoying working with others as an Educator, Counselor, and Case Manager. Starting in 2014 he apprenticed with a formidable yoga teacher for seven years, granting him the transmission to teach Hatha yoga. Afterwards, for three years, he trained at a Zen Buddhist monastery. This is ultimately what inspired him to become an End-of-Life Doula.

Outside of this work, Corey works as case manager for those living with severe mental illness. He is always aspired to work helping others. Corey spends his leisure time playing music, reading, and hiking in the mountains.
