\    Corey Coomes was formally trained as a photographer and animator, yet after college found himself working with others as an Educator, Counselor and Case Manager.   He apprenticed with a formidable yoga teacher for seven years, granting him the transmission to teach Hatha yoga. Corey then trained at a Zen Buddhist monastery for three years, which inspired him to work as an End of Life Doula.  He currently is a case manager for those living with severe mental illness.  Corey has always aspired to work with others.  He enjoys playing music, reading, a nice cup of tea, and hiking in the mountains.
