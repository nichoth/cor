As an end of life doula, Corey offers an array of experiences that nurture the dying as they depart on the Great journey we are all promised to embark on.  Assisting the transition into death with calm presence and unwavering support, Corey meets patients with warmth and compassion.  As a life long meditation practitioner who lived monastically, learner, yogi, artist and musician, Corey offers a multitude of resources and skills that will empower patients and their families.  Allowing people deemed terminal to orchestrate their finals days creatively, with dignity,  a sense of freedom and meaning, he cultivates an environment where the ancient art of dying can be fully encountered.  Looking beyond the surface and into the depths of the human spirit; our true nature.
